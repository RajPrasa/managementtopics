            The power management for microprocessors can be done over the whole processor, or in specific components, such as cache memory and main memory.

With dynamic voltage scaling and dynamic frequency scaling, the CPU core voltage, clock rate, or both, can be altered to decrease power consumption at the price of potentially lower performance. This is sometimes done in real time to optimize the power-performance tradeoff.

        <br>
            <br>Examples:

AMD Cool'n'Quiet
AMD PowerNow![1]
IBM EnergyScale[2]
Intel SpeedStep
Transmeta LongRun and LongRun2
VIA LongHaul (PowerSaver)
Additionally, processors can selectively power off internal circuitry (power gating). For example:

Newer Intel Core processors support ultra-fine power control over the functional units within the processors.
AMD CoolCore technology get more efficient performance by dynamically activating or turning off parts of the processor.[3]
Intel VRT technology split the chip into a 3.3V I/O section and a 2.9V core section. The lower core voltage reduces power consumption.

Heterogenous computing
ARM's big.LITTLE architecture can migrate processes between faster "big" cores and more power efficient "LITTLE" cores.
Much research has been done on the dynamic power reduction with the use of DVFS techniques. However, as technology continues to shrink, leakage power will become a dominant factor.[9] Power gating is a commonly used circuit technique to remove leakage by turning off the supply voltage of unused circuits. Power gating incurs energy overhead; therefore, unused circuits need to remain idle long enough to compensate this overheads. A novel micro-architectural technique[10] for run-time power-gating caches of GPUs saves leakage energy. Based on experiments on 16 different GPU workloads, the average energy savings achieved by the proposed technique is 54%. Shaders are the most power hungry component of a GPU, a predictive shader shut down power gating technique[11] achieves up to 46% leakage reduction on shader processors. The Predictive Shader Shutdown technique exploits workload variation across frames to eliminate leakage in shader clusters. Another technique called Deferred Geometry Pipeline seeks to minimize leakage in fixed-function geometry units by utilizing an imbalance between geometry and fragment computation across batches which removes up to 57% of the leakage in the fixed-function geometry units. A simple time-out power gating method can be applied to non-shader execution units which eliminates 83.3% of the leakage in non-shader execution units on average. All the three techniques stated above incur negligible performance degradation, less than 1%.
